# Who am I?

Tango dancer, casual player of Magic: The Gathering, and amateur musician in permanent training. Fan of good food and of everything chocolate.

Exceptionally adaptive professional with 10 years of experience in the IT industry looking for an intellectually stimulating environment. Accomplished technical leader, full-stack software developer and architect, infrastructure consultant, and business analyst. Hands-on experience in all stages of application lifecycle management and the underlying infrastructure, with focus on cloud solutions. Proactive, result-oriented, proven team leader and capable mentor.

# Professional Summary

I started working in 2009 as a software developer using primarily .NET and SQL Server, quickly becoming technical leader and software architect during a stint of 4 years working mainly with the same client, helping with other projects for short periods of time. In 2013 I moved to California to work as an on-site consultant for Tesla Motors. In 2014 I transitioned into IT Infrastructure, at the same time becoming IT manager for my employer, and kickstarting our infrastructure consulting practice. In 2017 I decided my passion really lied on the development side, so I became principal software architect and developer at Blitz.
